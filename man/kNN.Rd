\usage{
kNN(train, test, cl, k = 1, l = 0, prob = FALSE, use.all = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{train}{training dataset with m data samples and d dimensions. A matrix of m by d.}

\item{test}{test dataset with n data samples and d dimensions. A matrix of n by d}

\item{cl}{training ground-true class labels for m data samples. A vector of length m.}

\item{k}{the number of nearest neighbors}

\item{l}{minimum vote to make decision for prediction, i.e. less than k-l dissenting votes are allowed, even if k may be larger than inputted k due to ties.}

\item{prob}{a boolean. If \code{TRUE}, prediction probability is returned as output's attribute. If \code{FALSE}, only prediction labels are returned.}

\item{use.all}{controls the way of handling ties. If \code{TRUE}, all distances equal to the kth largest are used. If \code{FALSE}, a random selection of distances equal to the k-th nearest distance is chosen to select exactly k neighbours.}

\description{
Classfication Algorithm of K Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
}
\details{
Input a training dataset and its corresponding class labels, return the predicted classfications by taking majority votes of k-nearest neighbors' classes.
